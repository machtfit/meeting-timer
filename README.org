** Development
Have a Node environment, ideally using ~nvm~, then run:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE shell
make setup-dev
#+END_QUOTE

To run a development server with hot-reload and all that run:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE shell
make dev
#+END_QUOTE

** Build release
To build a release version run:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE shell
make release
#+END_QUOTE
The app can then be found in ~./release~.
